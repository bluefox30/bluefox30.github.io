A group of chess enthusiasts checked into a hotel after a large chess tournament. Rather than going straight to their
rooms, the group stayed together in the lobby discussing the day's events and recent victories.
  After an hour, the manager of the hotel entered the lobby and asked them to disperse.
  "But why?" they asked.
  The manager answered. "Because I can't stand chess nuts boasting in an open foyer."
